🧩 How It Works
The script selects all image elements and wraps them in a slider logic.

Navigation buttons update the current image.

Indicators are created dynamically based on the number of images.

State is maintained for the current slide index and updated on interaction.

💡 Potential Improvements
Add autoplay / pause functionality

Add swipe support for mobile

Add fade or slide transitions between images

Customize indicators (e.g., thumbnails)
